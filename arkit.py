ARK: Survival Evolved Toolkit

Only supports Python3, Python2 is end of life and outdated thus not supported.

Purpose:
  Provide a Python toolkit for ARK. Originally designed to unpack the workshop archives.

def unpack(src, dst):
    '''
    Unpacks ARK's Steam Workshop *.z archives.

    Accepts two arguments:
        src = Source File/Archive
        dst = Destination File

    Error Handling:
        Currently only logs errors with an archive integrity. Also logs some debug and info messages.
        All file system errors are handled by python core.

    Development Note:
        - Not thoroughly tested for errors. There may be instances where this method may fail either to extract a valid archive or detect a corrupt archive.
        - Create custom exceptions.
        - Prevent overwriting files unless requested to do so.
        - Create a batch method.
